# Applescripts for SONOS

This is a stop-gap collection of applescripts for the SONOS OS X controller. Whether or not applescript will be officially supported by SONOS is up in the air. Since most of what can be done is limited by GUI scripting, these scripts can easily break, further implementation is limited, and are overall very hacky.

At this point, there are scripts that can do the following:

- Play/Pause
- Volume Up
- Volume Down
- Mute
